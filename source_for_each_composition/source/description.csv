This version works with a payoff matrix whose entries are linearly dependent on 
the fitnesses of the players, i.e., F1 and F2. For example, if two WT play, the 1st gets
a + b (F2-F1), and the 2nd gets a + b (F1-F2). 
Also, the entries of the payoff matrix have noise terms.
d Phi / d t = F(t);
There are thresholds for F for : cycling -> G1-arrest -> G0 -> differentiation -> apoptosis.
Also it saves the data less frequantly, and more wisely.

This is old
